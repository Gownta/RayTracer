The final executable was compiled on my personal computer.
Invoke the program by calling ./rt [filename]. Filename defaults to scene.lua.

  My additional feature was the implementation of the Minimal Bounding Spheres
algorithm. Specifically, I implemented Emo Welzl's algorithm from his 1991
paper "Smallest enclosing disks (balls and ellipsoids)", published in "New
results and new trends in computer science" by Springer.
  I also implemented the simple center-of-mass bounding sphere algorithm,
which computes its origin as the average of the points it contains, then
finds the smallest radius required.
  The center-of-mass algorithm performs optimally on scaled platonic solids,
such as rectangles and dodecahedrons. However, it is not optimal on less
regular meshes, such as macho cows.
  For macho cows, center-of-mass produced a bounding circle of radius
5.95, about 8.6% larger than Welzl's 5.48. This causes macho cows to render
in 39.08s (user time), about 19% slower than Welzl's 32.85.
  The 8.6 and 19 are related. A sphere whose radius is k times larger than
another has a cross sectional area k^2 times larger. Since rays intersect
a cross section, increasing the macho cows' radius by 8.6% would increase
cow-intersection time by an expected (1.086)^2 = 18%. Since macho cows are by
far the most complicated objects in macho-cows, and account for the bulk of
all intersections, we then see about 18% speedup in overall rendering.

  My unique scene is a Go board. The picture the scene is based on,
inspiration.jpg, is from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Go_Board,_Hoge_Rielen,_BelgiumEdit_Fcb981.jpg.
The go pieces are arranged exactly the same in my image as in theirs.
The actual board is also a png, from http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Blank_Go_board.png.
