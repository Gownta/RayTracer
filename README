====
TODO

in primitives.cpp, make a better pow function (since I will only be calling it for powers of 0..4)
change --help's 'Allowed Options' to 'Options'
cast 4 rays per pixel - if they do not all yield the same colour, then anti-alias
EXISTENCE intersections need to be checked against the maximum distance

===========
ASSUMPTIONS

All meshes are closed shapes, so we may use Jordan Curve to determine if we are inside or outside.
